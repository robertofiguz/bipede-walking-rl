    This report covers the attempt to develop a bipedal walking pattern using reinforcement learning. 
 
    This project developed a series of experiments progressing from a testing ground using the CartPole environment to a 2D walker and implementation of OpenAI Gym on the RoboCup Team, Bold Hearts, ROS2 environment enabling training for any reinforcement learning task.
    The experiments cover the testing of two different learning implementations and hyperparameter tuning.
    
    
    Although the objective of walking could not be achieved in the target time frame with the limited resources available, the documentation covers the problems found along with how this difficulties were overcome. The implementation chapter will cover how each of the stages was developed, with coding examples for each of the main components.
   
    The results and findings of the experiment will be explored and an attempt to understand what could be changed to achieve achieving the desired outcome.
