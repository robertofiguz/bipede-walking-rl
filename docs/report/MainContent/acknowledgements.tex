\section*{Acknowledgement}
It is important to start by thanking Professor Daniel Polani as project supervisor and Doctor Alessandra Rossi as team captain and mentor, not only for all the support and guidance but for making me passionate about science making and for piquing my curiosity.

It is also important to mention all my fellow teammates from Bold Hearts for the patience and for all I've learnt from them during the last four years.

Lastly, my family and friends for always supporting my decisions and supporting me over the hardest times.
